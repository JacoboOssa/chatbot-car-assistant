# Development of a Car Troubleshooting Chatbot Expert System
Â 
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a medium-complexity expert system using Python and the Experta library to create a chatbot for car troubleshooting. The system will utilize Bayesian networks implemented with pgmpy to help users identify and fix common car issues. Users would input symptoms (like unusual noises, difficulty starting, or check engine light), and the system could suggest potential causes and fixes.
